# quantum-autoencoder
The primary purpose of our project is to construct a quantum autoencoder. Once we have successfully built the autoencoder, our next step will be to utilize it to perform a variety of complex tasks, namely digital compression. This process will enable us to compress quantum states without losing any critical information. Following this, we will also apply our model to denoising tasks, which will help in improving the signal quality by reducing the quantum noise. Lastly, we will explore its potential in the realm of quantum chemistry.

The concept for this project has been profoundly inspired by the [Qiskit notebook on Quantum Autoencoders](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/tutorials/12_quantum_autoencoder.html).
